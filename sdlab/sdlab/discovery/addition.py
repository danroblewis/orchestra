"""Judging a structural addition: does a model with it predict better than the model without it, when
both are fed outside inflows the addition did not tailor?

    test = addition_test(base_flows, with_flows, stocks, run, inflow="anchor")
    test["accept"], test["gain"], test["noise"]

The main line's judge runs every candidate with its OWN outside-inflow pieces, so a candidate whose
added structure moves what the pieces carried (a curve imitating an inflow change) can score as well
as one whose addition is real. Here the addition is judged against the base it was added to, and
both models are fed the BASE model's outside inflow (judges.py, "anchor"): the addition must explain
something the base's inflow does not already carry. With inflow="remeasure" both are instead fed
inflows of the base's form (the same stocks, the same piece times) whose values are re-measured with
each model's own dynamics frozen: the same inflow budget for both, values that fit each.

The margin is the judge's own noise: the gain (the base's error minus the model's, relative to the
base's, over 5, 20 and 100 steps) is computed per start, and the starts are block-bootstrapped (runs
from nearby starts overlap) to give its spread; an addition is accepted when the gain is more than
`z` spreads and more than `floor`. With `pieces` it must also leave the inflow it needs no larger
than the base's: its own pieces' variance (each stock in its own scale of change) no larger.
