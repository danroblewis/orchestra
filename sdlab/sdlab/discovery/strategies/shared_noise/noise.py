"""Shared noise: which stocks see the same draws, and at what ratio.

A flow's amount each step is one random draw (counting noise), and every stock the flow touches
sees that same draw. So the rows' unexplained changes (residuals, after the levels and the outside
inflow's pieces are taken out) carry structure the average rates cannot:

  - a move A -> B: A's and B's residuals share the draw with opposite signs, so
    cov(res_A, res_B) = -Var(draw), and the draw counts in both stocks' variances;
  - a link A => B (B's arrivals follow A's level, nothing leaves A): drawn on its own, so the
    residuals do not covary, and A's variance does not see it;
  - a co-flow (A -> B also uses up `per` of C): C's residual carries -per x the draw, so
    cov(res_C, res_B) = per x cov(res_A, res_B).

Counting noise has a variance equal to its mean (up to a dispersion fitted to the data). So every
reading of the matrix's gains (each one a move or a link) predicts the whole covariance matrix of the
residuals: sum over flows of dispersion x mean amount x v v', where v is -1 at the flow's source and
+1 at its destination. A move and a link in opposite directions between the same two stocks give the
same covariance, but not the same variances: a move out of A beyond A's own drain shows up in A's
variance. The reading that predicts the observed covariances best (each entry weighted by its own
sampling error) is kept, and a gain is decided only where flipping it costs clearly more than chance.
Optional guards (tried, see the experiment log): flips measured against the best reading's own
misfit (`misfit`), a move-one-way/link-the-other pair also tested reversed (`swap`), and variances
allowed to exceed the prediction (`one_sided`).
