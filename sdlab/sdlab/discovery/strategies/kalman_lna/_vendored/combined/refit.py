"""Every candidate's numbers refitted on the same terms before it is judged.

The specialists hand back numbers fitted their own way, some rounded to four significant figures.
On noise-free data that rounding alone costs a candidate thousands of nats against one fitted to
the data's precision, so the judge would be comparing how numbers were written, not structures.
Here each candidate's structure is kept and its numbers are fitted again by (weighted) least
squares of the one-step changes, all stocks together:

    dy_s(t) = sum over flows f of V[f, s] x m_f(t) x (theta_f . psi_f(t))

where V is where flow f takes from and gives to (co-flows included), m_f its effects at x_t (held
as found), and psi_f its rate's columns: 1 for a constant, the level it reads for a term, a gap
(goal - x) / time as a constant and a term; one set of columns per announced era segment, and one
value per distinct found outside-inflow value (a repeating profile keeps its values tied). Flows
into or out of unmeasured stocks and `available` rates keep their numbers. With counts each row is
weighted by the candidate's own one-step variance. Floors and caps are not in the fit; the judge
keeps the refitted numbers only if they make the candidate's likelihood better.
