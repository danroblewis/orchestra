"""kalman_lna: discovery for levels that are reported, not known (docs/research/kalman_lna.md).

The stocks are hidden states that move by the flows, with counting noise as the process noise
(lna's linear noise approximation: each flow a Poisson draw, a move's draw shared by both ends),
and the reported levels are observations of them: with a measurement error (absolute and
relative), at uneven times (each interval spans its steps), as means over a window (weekly
reports), late (a reporting delay, read where announced injections pin it), with gross
errors (left out), and with a stock counted at a scale (a bias, read where a move pins it). The
numbers come from the Kalman filter's likelihood, the flows from lna's atoms chosen by BIC
(run.py, search.py), unmeasured stocks between two measured ones as one more state (hidden.py).

Which reading the data need:
- points at uneven times, or one per window: the filter;
- every step, up to SMALL stocks (or announced injections): the filter's superset is fitted first
  (gross errors left out, a reporting delay read); a measurement error that gains LR_NOISE BIC
  prices sends the data to the filter (not where a stock sits at zero, nor where the atoms leave
  much variance beyond counting noise even with the error read: floors, effects and co-flows are
  outside the atoms, and a measurement error would stand in for them);
- gross errors the filter sees (a standardised innovation beyond 10, where counting noise and a
  misfit of the atoms stay below 6): the filter, which leaves them out;
- otherwise the base strategy's answer, unless the filter's search finds a reporting delay
  (injections), or a scale where the base reads a link beside a move into the same stock.

The base is its own copy of `combined` (as at commit ec2f9e8, in _vendored/). Where the filter is chosen and fails or runs out of
time, the base's answer is returned. Beyond SMALL stocks, with every step reported, the data go to
the base unchanged.
