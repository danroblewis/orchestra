"""combined: the specialist strategies run side by side, and one judge picks among their models
(docs/research/combined.md).

1. Candidates. Each specialist is called as a black box through its own `identify()`, so its
   improvements flow in, in this order: censored (floors that bind, stocks that run empty),
   effect_hats (effects of a third stock's level; also re-cuts the outside inflows), lna (the best
   single strategy on the test cases: flows chosen by the counting likelihood), hidden_transit (an
   unmeasured stock between two measured ones), periodic_inflows (an inflow that repeats),
   gap_prior (lna with a drain read off another stock written as the goal gap it equals),
   lna_pulses (one-step bursts taken out before lna reads the moves), lna_stack (lna with the
   revisit's stages composed; lna_loops is deliberately not a candidate: its wins are on cells the
   data cannot decide) and common_cause (independent and identical stocks, noise-free fits, inflow
   changes the data earns). censored and effect_hats go first because on the realistic models
   they are the best candidates and the lna family the slowest. The specialists that start from
   the matrix method's model, or from lna's, share one computation of it (shared.py). Each runs
   under a cap (deadline.py: `cap` seconds, never past the budget); one that raises or runs out of
   time is left out, and once the budget is spent the rest are skipped. The budget is `budget`
   seconds or 70% of what the caller's timer leaves.
2. One judge (judge.py): the one-step likelihood of the measured changes under each candidate's
   equations, applied exactly as the simulator applies them (measured inputs, floors, caps,
   effects, co-flows, unmeasured stocks run open loop), with counting noise read through the
   linear noise approximation (each flow a Poisson draw) or, for data that are not counts, each
   stock's own variance floored at the data's rounding; plus a BIC price of 0.5 log T for every
   number the candidate wrote down (params.py: rate numbers, inflow values and change places,
   effect points, co-flows, unmeasured stocks). Before it is judged, every candidate's numbers are
   refitted on the same terms (refit.py: least squares of the one-step changes, its structure
   kept), and the refitted numbers are kept when they raise its likelihood.
3. A behaviour guard first sets aside candidates that behave clearly worse over many steps than
   the best one: a candidate whose multi-step error on the data (the main line's judge: runs from
   many moments over 5, 20 and 100 steps, measured inputs fed, unmeasured stocks started from
   their open-loop estimate; 1 = no better than nothing changing) is above both `guard` (4) times
   the best candidate's and `guard_floor` (0.1). The one-step likelihood cannot see a model that
   drifts off over many steps (it picked such models on the realistic examples); the guard only
   removes them and never ranks the rest, because this in-data judge replays each model's own
   inflow pieces and so favours many pieces (a tighter guard, 2x, loses about 20 test cells).
4. The lowest score wins; exact ties go to the model with fewer flows that read a stock other
   than the ones they join, then to fewer numbers, then to the earlier name in PREFERENCE (the
   lna family first).

opts (also SDLAB_COMBINED, JSON): "specialists" (names, in order; default SPECIALISTS), "price"
(the BIC multiplier, default 1), "per_flow" (numbers a flow costs for being there, default 0: a
flow is priced by its numbers), "budget" (seconds, default 240), "cap" (seconds per specialist,
default 90), "refit" (refit every candidate's numbers, default on), "link_moves" (a link from outside reading a
stock offered as the move from it, kept when the score falls; default on), "guard" and "guard_floor"
(default 4 and 0.1; guard 0 turns it off), "trace" (keep every candidate's flows in the result).
