"""Output error: where the levels carry measurement error, the found structure's numbers refitted by
running the model through the whole record, and its parts revised on that fit (k8s-306, 2026-10-21;
docs/research/k8s-306-r3-oefit.md).

A one-step fit reads each step's change off the measured levels. Under measurement error the same
error is in the regressors and in the change, so drains come out too slow or too fast, a capacity
limit (MIN) is flattened into a proxy, and the flows that feed counters (stocks that only grow, whose
5% error buries their step changes) are lost. The instrumented refit (eiv.py) corrects the numbers of a
structure only where its instruments are strong, and it cannot change the structure.

Here the model is run from fitted starting levels through the whole record, step by step as the engine
steps (rates floored at 0, a stock's outflows sharing what it holds, announced injections added before
their step), and its levels are compared with the measured levels: the residual is the measurement
error plus the drift of the process noise, and no measured level is a regressor. The numbers (and the
starting levels) are fitted by weighted least squares (the run's derivatives carried with it, _sens), each stock's weight from a noise variance
a + b x level^2 fitted to its own residuals (feasible GLS, two passes; again after each search, which
then runs again from its answer, up to CYCLES times).

On that fit the structure is revised by a beam search (each round keeps the BEAM best new structures,
so a path may pass through a worse one), scored by the weighted squared error plus PRICE x log n per
number (Bayes'; a capacity limit's extra number at MIN_PRICE x log n), over one change at a time:
- drop a part (a term, or a flow between measured stocks);
- write a flow's term on its own source X as a capacity limit a x MIN(X, theta x Y), for each other
  stock Y that is not a counter and each measured input (theta from quantiles of X / Y, then fitted);
- give a flow whose rate reads another measured stock Z (and not its source) Z as its source, or have
  it read its source instead; make a drain into a stock a drain of another stock into it;
- add a move X -> C into a counter C from a stock X that is not a counter (a drain the counters
  receive), or a move between two stocks that move (neither a counter; "moves": beyond its announced
  injections and its noise);
- put back a part of the found structure that a revision dropped;
- give an outside inflow one more term on a measured level that is not a counter's, or an input (a link:
  k8s-307, docs/research/k8s-307-c1.md; a one-step fit on noisy levels picks a noise-free input in place
  of a noisy stock, and the instrumented refit then prunes the row).
A move (a flow between two measured stocks) is added or re-ended only between stocks of the same
announced unit: a flow carries one unit (requests do not pour into millicores; what crosses units is a
link). Without this a big noisy stock with an estimated outside inflow and outflow becomes a hub that
any misfit can be routed through.
The search runs from two seeds and keeps the one with the lower Gaussian -2 log-likelihood (each with
its own noise variances) plus price: the found structure, and the found structure with every such move
added (and every link on each outside inflow) and then thinned by the Wald statistic of its fit (the part furthest below its price dropped, one
fit a step). A strategy whose own fit gave little (an empty reading) is rebuilt from the second. The
search stops at a budget of simulated steps (`budget`; so the answer does not depend on the machine's
speed or load) with the best answer so far; a wall-clock cap (WALL) is only a safety net.
No outside flow is added or removed (the declared boundary), and an outside inflow fixed to a declared
input keeps its number (an outflow that reads an input is the fit's guess, and is revised). The same rule
for every case: nothing reads the case or its truth.

The output error is blind to the process noise, so two things are then read on a Kalman likelihood (an
extended Kalman filter with counting noise in every flow and measurement error a + b x level^2 in every
level, the noise fitted with the numbers; k8s-307):
- the structure: the best CHOICES structures the searches fitted are each fitted on it, and the lowest
  -2 log-likelihood plus log n per number is kept (the output error cannot tell a loop that empties a
  stock each step from a slower drain of a smaller inflow, which give the same levels on average);
- the numbers of the rates that read another stock, and of the drains of the stocks they feed: the
  output error runs such a rate on the other stock's simulated level, which the process noise moves off
  its measured path (an errors-in-variables of the simulation).
A found model with pieces or effects (forms this refit cannot run) is searched from the same flows with
those written as plain rates of the same mean amount, and judged against the found model as the shared
engine runs it; one with eras, co-flows or hidden stocks is left as it is.

It runs only when the data show measurement error (the one-step residuals of the found model are
negatively correlated from one step to the next beyond chance, eiv.white_z), and only on structures
it can run: constants, proportional and linear rates on measured stocks and inputs, and the offered
capacity series (capmin.py), and an expression of constants, terms and MIN(a x X, b x Y). The revised
model replaces the found one only when its output error is lower.
