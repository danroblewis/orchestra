"""Errors in variables: the found flows' numbers refitted by instrumental variables when the levels
carry measurement error (docs/research/eiv-refit.md).

A one-step fit regresses each stock's change y[i] - y[i-1] on the levels y[i-1]. When the levels are
measured with error, the same error sits in the regressor and (with the opposite sign) in the change,
so drains come out too fast and inflows follow to keep the steady state; the bias does not shrink
with more data. Instrumenting each row's regressors (the derivative of the step's change with respect
to each number) with the same derivative taken at the levels one step earlier, y[i-2], removes it:
measurement error is white, so y[i-2] is independent of the errors at i-1 and i, and counting noise
(each step's own draw) is independent of every earlier level, so the instrumented fit is consistent
under both. Measured inputs are their own instruments.

The instrumented numbers replace the found ones only when
- the data show measurement error: some stock's one-step residuals are negatively correlated from
  one step to the next beyond chance (p < ALPHA, one-sided, over the stocks; counting noise leaves
  them white, a structure that misses something leaves them smooth), and
- the refitted model runs at least as close to the data over 5, 20 and 100 steps (the main line's
  judge: a multi-step error, which measurement error does not bias), so a structure the instruments
  do not suit keeps its numbers.

Pruning (docs/research/k8s-303.md). Where the data show measurement error, the structure itself was
chosen on the biased one-step fit, so it can carry parts the instrumented fit cannot tell from nothing:
an exact, smooth input stands in for the noisy level it nearly copies (a spurious `outside -> inflight
= k x traffic`, an inflated drain), a drain is split between a move and an exit, chance pieces fill the
gap. Before the refit above, the parts are tested on the instrumented fit itself: each part's numbers
by their Wald statistic (sandwich covariance, the moments summed over the stocks per step with a
Bartlett window of 2 steps, since measurement error leaves them MA(1)), the part with the largest
shortfall below PRICE per number dropped (a part that never flows, its rate gone negative, first), and
the rest refitted, until every part pays its price. Rows a level outlier touches (a one-step residual
beyond TRIM robust sds) are left out of these fits. The pruned model is kept if, at the judge's longest
horizon, it runs no further from the data than the found one by more than GUARD paired standard errors
(over the judge's runs); at shorter horizons the measurement error at each run's start, which a
faster-draining model forgets sooner, still favours the biased numbers. Failing that, the last stage
before it is tried, and failing all, the refit above as before.
Flows that read a stock nobody measures are left as they are.

Moves (docs/research/k8s-303-c1.md). Where the data show measurement error, a stock whose error grows
with its level (a counter that reaches 10^5 with 5% error) has step changes whose noise buries what
flows in, so the one-step fit leaves its row empty and the flow that feeds it goes to outside. Its
level still holds what came in. After the refit, each drain to outside (X -> outside) is tried as a
move into each other measured stock R, on R's row in level space: R's measured level less what R's
flows (and announced injections) have added since the start, a free starting level, and noise of
variance a + b x level^2 (feasible GLS from the residuals, on the measured level; a squared residual is
counted at most TRIM^2 variances). Where R also takes an inflow from outside that reads X, the move
replacing it is tried too. The best one is made when its -2 log-likelihood on R's row, plus Bayes' log n
for each number it adds (one for choosing the receiver, less one for each number it replaces), is
lower than before by more than log n; repeat while one is. A move that duplicates a proportional move
already there is joined to it.
