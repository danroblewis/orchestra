# Vendored for combined2 from sdlab/discovery/strategies/common_cause/rows.py at commit 3f5f064 (HEAD ebe9a4f); imports
# rewritten to these copies, otherwise unchanged (CLAUDE.md invariant 11). Re-vendor rather than edit.
"""(earned_pieces, vendored at a3a5e01) Each row's levels and outside-inflow form chosen together, every change paying its full price.

The matrix chooses a row's levels in the presence of fine, cheap pieces (so that the levels are not
biased by unexplained changes) and only at the end asks whether the pieces pay. When they do not,
the row keeps the levels chosen beside them: often too few (a level the pieces stood in for), so
that the pieces then pay after all, for the levels' sake. Here the matrix's row is one candidate;
the others are the levels chosen afresh by backward elimination from every level the row may read
(and, with numbers per configuration, every level's number per configuration), with no outside
inflow, a constant one, or the matrix's pieces. All are compared by BIC with each change in the
outside inflow priced as a value and a place (2 parameters).
