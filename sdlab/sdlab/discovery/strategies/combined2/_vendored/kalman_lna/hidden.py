# Vendored for combined2 from sdlab/discovery/strategies/kalman_lna/hidden.py at commit 6a93270 (HEAD ebe9a4f); imports
# rewritten to these copies, otherwise unchanged (CLAUDE.md invariant 11). Re-vendor rather than edit.
"""An unmeasured stock between two measured ones (A -> H -> B), as one more state of the filter.

Where the chosen model has B gaining in proportion to A (a move A -> B or a link A => B), the
alternative routes A's loss through H: a move A -> H at k and a move H -> B at d (a delay of 1 / d),
one number more than the move. H is never seen; the filter follows it from A's and B's reports (its
counting noise is shared with both, as a move's is). Kept when it beats the model as it stands by
the BIC price of its extra number plus a margin, with a delay H turns over many times in the run.
