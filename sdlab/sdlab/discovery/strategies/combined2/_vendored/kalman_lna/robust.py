"""Gross errors found before any model: a single reported value far from both its neighbours, in
the same direction, while the neighbours agree with each other (a level that jumps and stays is a
change; a peak of a curve or a pulse that decays is not an error; one value that jumps and comes
straight back is). Far means beyond CUT robust standard deviations of the point-to-point scatter,
beyond RATIO times the neighbours' own difference, and beyond FRAC of the stock's level around it (a
gross error is large against the level itself). Values just after an announced injection are never
errors."""
