"""A time cap on one specialist, nested inside whatever cap the caller already set.

The ladder's runner limits each item with SIGALRM. A specialist that would use the whole item's time
(the lna family on a realistic model) is stopped earlier here, so the others still run: the outer
timer is read, a shorter one set, and the outer one put back afterwards with the time used taken
off. `Overrun` derives from BaseException, so a specialist's own `except Exception` does not
swallow it. Off the main thread, or without SIGALRM, nothing is capped.
