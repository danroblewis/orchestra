# Vendored for combined2 from sdlab/discovery/strategies/combined/shared.py at commit beab53e (HEAD 05ae898); imports
# rewritten to these copies, otherwise unchanged (CLAUDE.md invariant 11). Re-vendor rather than edit.
"""The main line's model, and lna's, computed once per run for every specialist that starts from
them.

lna, censored, hidden_transit, effect_hats, periodic_inflows, lna_loops, lna_pulses and lna_stack each
begin
with the matrix method's `identify` on the same data (the most expensive shared step); gap_prior and
lna_pulses begin with lna's. While `once()` is open, the name each of them imported it under points
to a cached copy, so it runs once per distinct set of options; each caller gets its own deep copy
(some edit the result in place). The specialists' own code is not touched: if one renames its
import, it simply runs the step itself again.
