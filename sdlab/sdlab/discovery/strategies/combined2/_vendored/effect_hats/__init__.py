"""Effects as tent columns: a flow's rate multiplied by a piecewise-linear curve of a stock's level,
found and fitted by least squares (docs/research/effect-hats.md).

1. The matrix method's model is the base.
2. Screen (screen.py): every pair (base, C) as a group of tent columns base x h_j(C) (basis.py) on
   what the rows leave unexplained; a pair that clearly explains one or two rows is a candidate.
3. Search (search.py): for each candidate and each way its flow can run (between the rows it shows
   in, or out of its base stock), the curve's weights are fitted jointly in those rows (the shared
   group with the flow's signs; knot count by BIC), and the placements compared on the same rows.
   The curve becomes a virtual stock base x f(C) offered to the matrix method in those rows; the
   result is read back into flows with table effects, a drain on the same curve as a move becoming
   its co-flow (translate.py), and every number, the curves' included, refitted jointly across all
   rows (joint.py).
4. The best few are finished: outside inflows pooled into a few values and re-cut where they change
   (pieces.py; per-stretch pieces read a drain up to 20% fast under counting noise), flows the joint
   BIC does not need dropped, and judged.
5. A candidate replaces the base only if its curve explains both halves of the data, it prices better
   (one-step BIC, pooled pieces counted once) than the base with its inflows re-cut the same way, and
   behaves within `margin` of it; among those, the lowest price wins (a flow whose rate is not its
   source's level pays `prior` x log T). With `rounds` > 1 the screen runs again with the accepted
   effects' columns taken out. Without an accepted effect, the base with its inflows re-cut is
   returned when it prices better and behaves within `seg_margin` (seg_base).

opts (also SDLAB_EFFECT_HATS_OPTS, JSON), defaults in DEFAULTS: margin, select ("bic" or "judge"),
prior, knots (knot counts tried), most (candidates per round), per_candidate (placements), finish
(models finished per round), halves, weighted (rows weighted by their noise), prune, pool (re-cut
inflows), guard (steps next to an inflow change left out of the fit), level_price (extra price of
an inflow value, in log T), seg_base, seg_margin, rounds.

Measured inputs (opts "inputs", inputs.py) are columns in every fit (the matrix's, the screen's, each
curve's, the joint refit's) and every model is priced and judged stepped with them.
