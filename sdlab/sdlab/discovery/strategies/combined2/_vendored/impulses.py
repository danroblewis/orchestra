"""Pulses as their own kind of input (docs/research/impulse-inputs.md).

One-step deliveries and short bursts are found in each stock's change jointly with the row's numbers
(pulses.joint: find the pulses in what the levels leave, refit the row without the pulse steps,
repeat), first with the stock's own level as the only column, then with the columns a fitted
matrix chose (rounds). A sudden loss is kept only where another stock gains in the same step (a
batch moved, or a co-flow used up); deliveries from outside are kept on their own. The pulses are
handed to the main line as known changes (opts["known"]: taken out of the rows before they are
fitted, and fed to every candidate when it is judged), so no drain has to absorb them, and are
returned as outside flows that arrive in those steps only.

Options (opts["impulses"], a dict): rounds (matrix fits for the joint detection, default 2);
max_len (longest burst, default 6); thresh (default sqrt(2 log(T x max_len)) robust SDs);
max_share (default 0.3 of the steps); sign (0 both, 1 gains only); paired_outflows ("any": a loss
needs a gain in any other stock, "unit": in a stock of its unit, "" keeps every loss); counts
(default True: whole-number stocks get a counting-noise floor on the scale); start ("own", or
"median": around a running median of the change, mistakes fast stocks' inflow changes for bursts);
fit (the matrix variant for the rounds); trace (a stock id: print each round's numbers).
