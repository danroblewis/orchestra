"""An outflow capped by what its stock holds, found by profiling the outflow's constant.

When a stock's outflows want more than it holds, the engine gives them what it has: on those steps
the stock ends holding only what arrived, and the change is "inflow - level", not "inflow - demand".
A straight one-step fit cannot tell a constant demand D from the outside inflow u (only u - D is
seen while the stock has stock), but the emptied steps can: there, everything leaves. So for each D
(and own drain d) on a grid, the outside inflow is what the row's change says arrived,

    u_t = change_t - (moves in)_t + min(level_t, D + d x level_t + (other outflows wanted)_t),

cut into pieces of constant mean (PELT; each change priced at `mult` x log n x the noise variance,
2 by default: the main line's 1 cuts pure counting noise into dozens of pieces), and the (D, d)
whose pieces fit best by BIC is kept, refined by a local search with the cuts held. D = 0 is the
plain fit (returned as "plain_fit"), so a cap is offered only where the emptied steps say it binds.
