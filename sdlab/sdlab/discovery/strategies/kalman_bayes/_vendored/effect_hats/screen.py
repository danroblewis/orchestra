# vendored copies; otherwise unchanged). Do not edit: re-vendor instead.
"""Where an effect might be: a group of tent columns base x h_j(C) that explains what the rows leave.

For every pair (base: a measured stock or 1, C: a measured stock that moves), the group of K tent
columns of C times the base is projected, after the levels (and the pieces of each row's changing
outside inflow, as effects.py does), on what each row leaves unexplained. The group's gain in a row is
the share of that row's noise it explains; a flow shows in up to two rows (where it leaves, where it
arrives), so a pair's score is its two best rows less the group's price (K - 1 numbers per row).
A product base x C is one column whichever stock is called the base, so both readings are kept as
candidates and the joint fit and the judge choose.
