"""Experiment hidden_transit (docs/research/hidden_transit.md): an unmeasured transit stock between
two measured ones (A -> H -> B), with the pair's rows refitted as one model by a Kalman filter's
likelihood, on top of the main line.

The main line's model is found as usual. Then, for every pair (A loses in proportion to its level,
to outside or straight to B; B gets things from outside or from A), the pair's rows are refitted
twice by the same likelihood (kalman.py, fit.py): as a transit stock (A's loss goes into H, H drains
into B at d a step: a delay of 1 / d) and as the plain alternative (B gets a share of A's loss
straight away). Each in variants: A's outside inflow refitted as one constant or kept as found; B with
or without an outside constant. The transit stock is accepted when its best variant beats the best
plain one by BIC (numbers fitted, and pieces kept from the main line, cost log T each) by a margin,
and the model with it behaves better on the data than the main line's with B's outside
inflow held at its mean (its pieces, fitted to this run, would make it look better on it). Pairs are taken greedily,
best first, each stock in one pair at most.

"All of A's loss goes to H" (kin = kA) is the default: B's response to A alone cannot tell a
delay d with B's drain kb from the mirror (d and kb swapped, kin scaled), but A's balance can.
A share (kin < kA, the rest to outside) is accepted only when it is better by BIC.

The counting noise is used as it is: the data are counts (whole numbers), so each flow's variance is
its rate (scale 1), which also pins the rates' sizes where a short run's mean levels cannot. Data
that are not counts get a concentrated scale.

opts: "ht_margin" (BIC margin, default 10), "ht_slack" (the model may behave this much worse than the
reference on the data, default 0: it must behave better), "ht_max" (hidden stocks at most, default 2), "ht_turns" (H must turn over at least this many
times in the run: delay <= T / ht_turns, default 15), "ht_min_delay" (a shorter delay is a move;
default 1.5 steps), "ht_trace".
