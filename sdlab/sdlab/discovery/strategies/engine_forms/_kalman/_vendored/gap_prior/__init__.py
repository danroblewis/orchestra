"""gap_prior: lna, with readings the data cannot tell apart written the way SD models write them.

Without noise, a goal gap in b's outside inflow (c - k x a) and b's constant inflow c beside a drain
of b that reads another stock a (b loses k x a) are the same equation for b: the matrix returns the
drain. SD models do not drain a stock by another stock's level alone (an outflow reads its own
stock); a stock's inflow that falls as another stock rises is a goal gap. So, where the data are
noise-free (lna returned the matrix's reading), each such drain beside a single constant inflow is
written as the gap it equals: one flow instead of two, the same behaviour. Likewise a drain of c read
by a stock a that moves things on (a -> b) is, in the averages, a co-flow of that move (each unit
moved uses up per = drain / move of c; lna/coflows.py): where a has such a move, the drain is
written as the co-flow (checked first: a gap needs no move). With counting noise lna's likelihood
tells these apart (its gap swaps and co-flow offers) and its reading stands. A rewrite is kept only
when the judge finds it behaves as the original on the run (it claims the same equations), and
never between stocks whose levels are copies of each other (identical stocks: there the matrix's
cross readings are a choice between collinear columns, and a rewrite behaves differently off the
run).

This is a convention for an unidentifiable choice, not identification; it comes from
docs/research/identifiability.md and judge-ties.md (ties broken by the simpler, conventional model)
and is measured in docs/research/revisit.md.
