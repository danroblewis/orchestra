"""Noise-free data: least squares that knows where float precision ends.

On exact data a row's true columns fit to rounding error, so its residual sum of squares is
numerical junk (1e-20 of the signal, or 1e-9 from fit_subset's ridge). Two shared pieces then go
wrong:

- BIC compares T x log(rss): between two junk values, any column that shaves the junk "gains"
  hundreds, so stepwise keeps adding columns, and the greedy path that took a wrong column first
  never finds the sparse exact fit (with an exact collinearity among the levels, several sets fit
  exactly and only the sparsest is the truth);
- PELT prices a change by the variance of the residual's successive differences: on junk that is
  ~0, so the ridge's tiny systematic bias is cut into many pieces.

Both are fixed by a floor at the data's precision: a fit's rss is never below REL x T x the mean
square of every stock's change (so all exact fits tie, and backward steps drop what the floor
cannot see), and PELT's noise variance is never below the same scale. With counting noise the
floor is far below the noise and changes nothing.

`floored(dy)` patches the shared functions in place for the duration of one identify call (each
ladder and bench item runs in its own process, one at a time), and restores them after.
