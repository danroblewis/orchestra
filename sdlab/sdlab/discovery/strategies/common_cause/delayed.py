"""A row whose inflow arrives through a hidden first-order delay (kubernetes 312, 2026-10-22).

docs/research/fixes/312-kalman_lna.md. A measured stock S may be fed from outside through a stock nobody measures,
H (a DELAY1: H' = u - a H, S gains a H a step), where the order u is itself floored, u = max(0, C . x) (an order
placed only while a shortfall is positive). S's row is then

    dS = a H + X_A lin - max(0, X_B . b)        H_{t+1} = (1 - a) H_t + max(0, X_C . c)_t,   H_0 a number

(an always-on linear part and at most one floored outflow beside it). Every number is linear once a and the two
active sets are fixed, so the fit is the floored row's active-set least squares with the delayed columns
G_a(on . x) = a sum_s (1 - a)^(t-1-s) on_s x_s, and a decay column for H_0:

1. the outflow's start: the floored outflow read off S's change alone (the steps it falls);
2. for each a on a grid (delays of 1 to 50 steps), the order u is read off the inflow part by inverting the delay,
   u_t = (v_{t+1} - (1 - a) v_t) / a (v: S's change less the outflow and the linear part), its readers searched
   as a floored term's are (every subset up to SUB levels, on the steps the order is placed, re-read), and the
   best few judged by the joint refit of the whole row;
3. a refined by golden section around the best grid point, the outflow and the linear part refitted on what the
   delayed inflow leaves, and the search repeated (ROUNDS);
4. kept by the caller where its BIC beats the row's other forms (a schedule, an integrator) by PRICE log T.

It is written by rows.py as the found model's own hidden stock: outside -> H at max(0, C . x), H -> S at a H.
Nothing reads the case or its truth; the same rule for every row with an inflow side.

To adopt it in another strategy: copy this file with kalman_lna's rows.py (it calls `fit` from `row`, and `_build`
writes the two flows); numpy and scipy.signal only.
