"""Shared change places: a common cause steps several outside inflows at the same moments.

A stock whose outside inflow steps when another's does can be fitted, nearly as well and far more
cheaply, by reading the other stock's level (it follows its own inflow within a few steps): one
number in place of a value and a place for every change. Priced row by row, BIC takes the
cross-link. But a change place already earned by another row's pieces is known: this row pays only
for its values there. So each row is offered one more candidate: pieces at the places the other
rows earned (each a value, 1 parameter), with its levels chosen afresh by backward elimination from
every level it may read. A cross-link survives only if it explains something those shared pieces do
not; a row that does not change with the others pays a value per place for nothing and keeps its
own form.
