"""A capacity limit: a flow out of X at MIN(a x X, b x Y) (docs/research/k8s-306-s1.md, 2026-10-21).

A rate that is the lesser of a demand on X and a capacity read off Y (another measured stock that is
not a counter, or a measured input) is not linear in the levels, so a linear row fit replaces it by a
proxy and the rest of the model compensates. Here it is offered to the strategy's own fit as one more
measured series, the regime-clipped source `m = MIN(X, theta x Y)`, so `a x m` is an ordinary linear
term that the strategy fits, prices and keeps or drops jointly with the rest of its model
(theta = b / a, the regime threshold). Afterwards every term reading m is written back as
`MIN(a x X, a theta x Y)` (an expression flow), so the answer reads only measured stocks and inputs.

`offer` finds (X, Y, theta) from the data alone. For each non-final measured stock X, its one-step
changes are regressed on a constant, every measured level and every input, with and without m; theta
is chosen over quantiles of X / Y and refined by golden section. The best pair is then refined on X's
row together with the other row m explains best (where the flow goes), by the profile likelihood of
both rows. m is offered only where it wins decisively on X's row: Gaussian BIC better by more than
PRICE x log T, with each regime holding on at least MIN_SHARE of the steps (a limit that never binds,
or always does, is a linear rate). The same rule for every case; nothing reads the case or its truth.

This file is copied into each strategy that uses it (strategies are isolated, CLAUDE.md rule 11); the
copies are identical when written.
