"""Conservation decided by all the rows at once, with counting noise as evidence.

The matrix fits each stock's row alone and then sets a drain to what the receivers are seen to take
unless the source's row clearly objects (matrix.conserve). Two things are lost that way:

- the receivers' numbers are measured too: when the source's row and the receivers' rows disagree,
  the shared number (the move) should come from both, each by its precision;
- whole things move (counting noise), so a row's residual variance is the stock's gross throughput:
  everything in plus everything out. An exit beside a move changes the throughput the source's row
  claims, and that is seen in the residuals even when the levels barely move (a stock that sits at its
  equilibrium, where an inflow and a drain trade off one for one).

Here every row keeps the columns and outside-inflow pieces it was fitted with; the numbers are
fitted jointly by weighted least squares, each step weighted by 1 / its throughput, and with a set
of ties: for a tied source a (in each configuration), a's own number is minus the sum of what its
same-unit receivers gain from a (no exit to outside). Each source is tied or freed by BIC on the
counting likelihood: residuals Gaussian with variance phi x gross, phi shared by the stocks of a
unit (the noise process is the same), so -2 log L = sum log(phi g) + e^2 / (phi g).
