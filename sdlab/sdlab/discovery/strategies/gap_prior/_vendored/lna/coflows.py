"""Co-flows: a move a -> b that uses up `per` of c as it goes.

In the averages a co-flow is a move plus a drain of c driven by a (c loses per x the move's rate),
so the two readings fit the means equally well. The covariance tells them apart: a co-flow's draw is
shared by a, b and c (c mirrors it at the ratio per), an independent drain is drawn on its own. So a
drain of c driven by a beside a move a -> b offers a co-flow atom with per = drain / move, the
pruning keeps whichever reading the likelihood prefers, and per is then refined.
