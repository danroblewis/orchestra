"""A whole model's one-step fit, priced by its size: an information criterion over every stock.

Judging by runs on the data feeds a model its own estimated outside inflows, so a model whose
inflow pieces mimic dynamics it lacks can look as good as one that has them. Here every number
costs log T, the pieces included: the model with effects that needs fewer pieces wins only if
it fits the steps as well.
