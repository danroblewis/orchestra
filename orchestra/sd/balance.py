"""A level's balance: the counters, each added or subtracted, that explain its changes.

``Δlevel ≈ Σ inflows − Σ outflows`` in every step. The counters are found by a local search on an
objective of squared error plus a penalty per counter used, so a counter must explain a real share
to be kept: at least ``MIN_GAIN`` of the level's variance, and at least one event's worth of
squared change (``EVENT_FLOOR``), because on a level that barely moves one per cent of its variance
is less than the noise of a single step at the edge of the window. A balance that is exact in every
step earns back most of one penalty (``COMPLETION``): the rare counter that makes it exact (a
refund among a hundred orders) is then worth keeping, where alone it could never pay its way. A
counter that counted fewer than ``MIN_EVENTS`` events is not searched: on three events a level
and a counter coincide by chance as readily as a stock and its flow. It may only complete a
balance (``complete``), exactly. The bar is on the evidence for the balance, not on each counter:
counters below the bar alone carry a balance only when together they make it exact in every step
and counted at least ``MIN_EVENTS`` between them (a state work is sent back to, three rejections
from review and one from the merge, four returns to work: eight changes, each explained, and no
counter moving when the level did not). Short of exact, they are no balance.

The search is cheap because it runs on the counters' Gram matrix (every pair's dot product): the
error after any one change is a few multiplications, not a pass over the steps. That pays for
starting it from many places and keeping the best, which a search from one start needs: one term
of a balance alone often makes the fit worse (inflow without its outflows), and which local
optimum a single start reaches depends on noise.

A counter far larger than the level (``resolvable``) is not searched: its squares' rounding is
more than the level's variance.

A level slower than the grid (``sd.resolution``) is judged on the stretches between its writes,
not on single steps: ``units`` turns the steps into those stretches, and every function here that
takes a level does so, so a balance found on them is checked on them again wherever it is."""
