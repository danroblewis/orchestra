"""Which machines may be associated with each flow: hypotheses with their evidence, never a label
and never a declaration (AGENTS.md rules 2, 6 and 7).

System dynamics has no machines. A machine does actual work (a program, an AI agent, a person) and
is known by its events on the bus; how its work relates to the model's flows is unknown, and
inferring it is what Orchestra is for. A machine may be associated with no flow, one or several,
and several machines with one flow. A flow's counter is a measurement of the system: who wrote it
(an instrument, or the ``machine`` label of a series) says nothing about which machine's work it
reflects, so it is never read for this; nor does any configuration or plugin say it.

Each hypothesis is recorded in ``flow.evidence["machines"]`` (``hypotheses``, best first, each with
its evidence and a ``confidence`` between 0 and 1), from one of:

- **its own events**: the flow's counter is itself one machine's event count
  (``orchestra_events_total`` of one type and source);
- **events on the bus**: a machine whose own events, counted per (type, source) in
  ``orchestra_events_total``, match the counter's increments over the window. The events of one
  type from one machine (its instances summed) are compared with the counter in three ways, and
  the first that holds is the evidence:

  1. *step by step*: at the same step or one step either way for the whole window (two clocks,
     two writes), their increments are equal in at least ``EQUAL_STEPS`` of the steps either moved
     in (confidence: that share);
  2. *event by event*: each increment of the counter is paired with an event no more than one
     step away (``TOLERANCE``), so events that straddle a step boundary, some early and some on
     time, still pair. Two-sided when at least ``EQUAL_STEPS`` of the counter's increments and of
     the events pair; one-sided when every increment of the counter pairs, with the events' total
     within ``RATIO`` of the counter's (the rest of the events may feed another flow; confidence:
     the share of the events that pair). Either is discounted for chance: the same events moved
     far away in time (``CHANCE_SHIFTS``) pair too, by coincidence, with a share that is subtracted
     (confidence: ``paired - chance``, so a match chance could half make is never near certain;
     two-sided only when ``(paired - chance) / (1 - chance)`` is at least ``EQUAL_STEPS``), and a counter so busy that chance alone
     pairs more than ``MAX_CHANCE`` of it is never matched this way;
  3. *by correlation*: they correlate at least ``MIN_CORR`` at one of those lags with totals
     within ``RATIO`` of each other (confidence: the correlation times the smaller ratio of the
     totals).

  Step by step and by correlation are discounted for chance as event by event is: the events
  moved ``CHANCE_SHIFTS`` steps around the live steps are measured the same way, and that share is
  subtracted (a busy event type matches an unrelated counter step by step mostly by coincidence);
  a hypothesis chance makes as well is dropped. An event type that feeds two ways out of one stock
  (a subject ended one way or another) is hypothesised on each, in proportion to the events that
  pair with its counter, when the events its counter did not take pair with the other exits'.

  Every machine that matches is a hypothesis. Machines that tie on every test form one group
  (``tied``) that shares the confidence: timing cannot tell them apart. While the counter has fewer
  than discovery's ``MIN_EVENTS`` events, each confidence is scaled by its share of them
  (``capped``): a few events coincide by chance.

**People relayed from one system are tested together** (``orchestra.people``): a bridge relays
each act on a system it reads as the person who did it (``person.<system>.<account>``), and at work
that is hundreds of machines, each a candidate for every flow (600 people cost 3.6 s for 22 flows,
2026-11-04). When at least ``GROUP_MIN`` of one system's people have events, their events of each
type are summed into one candidate and compared with the counter once, as a machine's instances
are summed. When it matches, the hypothesis is each of those people who published that type in the
window, named as machines, as ever, sharing the group's confidence (they tie, and timing could not
tell them apart one by one either), the busiest first, with the group in ``together`` (every
person in it, and why). An owner-mapped ``person.<key>`` is tested on its own. The limit: one
person whose events alone match a counter, among many of the system's people publishing the same
type, is not told apart from them.

A counter of traffic on another system's bus (``orchestra.sources.traffic``) carries the
producer or consumer its definition names in its ``machine`` label; that is a label (or, with
``[sources.producers]``, a declaration), so it is not read here either.

A flow with no hypothesis says so: no machine associated yet. That is a question about the system,
not an answer. None of this changes a flow's equation or the model's stocks and flows. Its limits:
a match is a correlation in time, not a cause; two machines reacting to the same events both match;
and discovery itself may not tell apart two similar flows between the same stocks, so a
hypothesis may belong to a flow's twin. Orchestra's own event types (``orchestra.*``:
announcements, the host's and the launcher's) are never candidates."""
