"""The metrics store: the history of every measured series. Stocks' current values are queries.

A series is a name plus labels, like Prometheus. Every series carries a ``project`` label, so
projects never collide in a shared store, and readers select a project's series by it.
Orchestra's own series start with ``orchestra_``; a project's programs name theirs for what they
measure and write them through ``for_repo`` (docs/machines.md), which adds the label. Collectors
(``orchestra.collectors``) write points; models and fitting read ranges.

Backends, chosen by ``[metrics] url`` in ``orchestra.toml`` or ``ORCHESTRA_METRICS_URL``:
``file`` (the default: ``<state>/metrics.jsonl``) and ``http://host:port`` (VictoriaMetrics, or
anything that speaks its JSON-lines import and the Prometheus query API).

Reading a range uses the last value at or before each step (a stock holds its level until the
next change), the same rule Prometheus-style stores use within their lookback window. The file
backend carries a value forward without limit; ask VictoriaMetrics for ranges with a step no
longer than its lookback (5 minutes by default, ``-search.maxStalenessInterval``) or query raw."""
