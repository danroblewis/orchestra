"""Hat functions: a curve of a stock's level as a weighted sum of tents over a few knots.

A piecewise-linear curve through (x_j, w_j) is sum_j w_j h_j(x), with h_j the tent that is 1 at knot
j and 0 at its neighbours (the first and last stay 1 beyond the ends, as an SD Lab table effect stays
flat beyond its points). The tents sum to 1, so a rate base x f(C) is linear in the w_j: the columns
base x h_j(C) go into least squares like levels, and the fitted weights are the table's values.
