# Vendored for kalman_lna from sdlab/discovery/strategies/lna_stack/__init__.py at commit ec2f9e8 (imports rewritten to the
# vendored copies; otherwise unchanged). Do not edit: re-vendor instead.
"""lna_stack: lna with the stages built when past ideas were revisited on the ladder
(docs/research/revisit.md) that are recommended, in one model: pulses found first and taken out
(lna_pulses), moves scaled by a third stock (lna_products), inflow pieces as recurring levels
(lna_levels), and, on noise-free runs, ties written the way SD models write them (gap_prior: goal
gaps and co-flows, kept when they behave as the original) and pulses re-measured on the matrix's
model. Each stage is its own package's hooks on lna (lna/run.py HOOKS), unchanged, so this strategy shows
whether they compose; lna's data, stride, measured inputs and budget are lna's own (one budget for
all of its searches). lna_loops is left out: its passes are on cells the data cannot decide, and it can make a
noisy chain behave much worse (revisit.md).
