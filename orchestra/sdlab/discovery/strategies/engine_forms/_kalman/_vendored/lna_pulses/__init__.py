"""lna_pulses: pulses (one-step arrivals, short bursts) found first, then lna on what they leave.

The impulse-inputs experiment (docs/research/impulse-inputs.md, strategy `impulses`) found pulses
jointly with each row and handed them to the matrix as known changes. On the ladder it passes the
pulse case only where the matrix itself does; on noisy runs the matrix's reading of the chain is
what fails. Here the same detection (`impulses.find_pulses`) feeds lna: the pulses are taken out of
each step's change before the counting-noise likelihood reads the moves, so a burst of 300 is not
read as a move, a link or a drain. Without noise (where lna is the matrix's reading) the chosen
model's outside inflows are re-measured with the pulse steps left out. Either way the pulses are
returned as outside flows that arrive in those steps only (as `impulses` writes them). With no
pulse found, the result is lna's. The pulses go out through lna's `data` hook (run.py); lna's
searches here share one lna budget, so lna's data handling, stride and time limit are lna's own.
