"""matrix.identify_one, finish and conserve, with the least-squares pieces they call passed in.

Copied from sdlab/discovery/matrix.py at commit 19fd8f8 (the file last changed at cb97c26). The
only changes: each function takes `ops` (fit_subset, stepwise, pelt; the shared ones by default)
in place of the module-level names, passes it on (identify_one -> finish -> conserve), and the
lazy import of hinges is absolute. common_cause's exact-data fix (exact.ops) is passed in here, so
the shared modules are never patched at runtime (queue item 2h).
