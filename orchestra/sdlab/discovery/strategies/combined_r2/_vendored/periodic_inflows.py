"""Outside inflows as a repeating profile (docs/research/periodic-inflows.md).

The main line first. Then each stock whose outside inflow is better told, by BIC, as one period's
profile repeated plus a slow level (discovery/periodic.py) has that inflow taken out as known, and the
main line runs again on the rest: its rows' levels are fitted beside the profile instead of beside
pieces that could follow anything, and whatever the profile leaves is still free to become pieces.
The profile is written into the result as an ordinary outside inflow in segments (with the pieces the
second pass found added in), so the simulator and the page are unchanged. Without a period that pays,
the result is the main line's.
