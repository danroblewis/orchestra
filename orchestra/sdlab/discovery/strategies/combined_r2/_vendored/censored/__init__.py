"""Censored: floors and caps fitted in the form the engine steps them, on top of the main line.

Every rate in SD Lab is max(0, ...), and a stock's outflows share what it holds when they want more
(sdlab/sdtruth.py). Where a floor or a cap binds, the measured change is not the flows' equation,
and the main line's straight one-step rows cannot say so: a link c - k x_j that stops at zero comes
out as a drain on x_j plus inflow pieces copying the kink (024-floor-binds), and a constant demand
from a stock that runs empty cannot be told from its inflow at all (only their difference moves the
stock while it holds something; 025-runs-empty gets no flows).

This strategy takes the main line's chosen model and, row by row, offers two rewrites of the row's
flows to and from outside (moves between measured stocks are kept):

- floor.py: a hinge a x max(0, s (x_j - theta)) beside the row's own level (and the other levels it
  read), its threshold chosen by a search over x_j's range; read back as a floored linear rate;
- cap.py: a constant demand D (and own drain d) capped by the level, with the outside inflow in
  pieces measured as what arrived, D chosen by profiling the pieces' fit.

A rewrite is kept only if the whole model's one-step BIC, with floors and caps applied as the engine
applies them (onestep.py), improves by more than `margin` x log T. (Option `judge_slack`: also ask
the result to behave on the data no worse than that many times the main line's model by the main
line's judge; off by default, because that judge replays each model's own inflow pieces and so
prefers the main line's many pieces even where the rewrite is the truth: 013 counts-short, 2.15x.)

Measured inputs (opts "inputs": {name: value per step aligned with t}) are read as the matrix reads
them: every model is stepped with them (a flow k x input moves what the input says, never 0), a
rewrite that replaces a row's flow on an input refits the input's number as a column beside the
hinge or the link, and the cap keeps the row's input flows as they are, counted in what arrived or
was wanted. An input's effect is thus in the model once.
