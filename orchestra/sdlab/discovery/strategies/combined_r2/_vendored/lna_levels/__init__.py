"""lna_levels: lna, with each outside inflow's pieces offered as a few recurring levels, and a
stock's growth with itself beside an inflow offered back as inflow pieces (levels.py).

From the regime-models and inflow-innovations ideas (docs/research/regime-models.md,
inflow-innovations.md; never built on the old bench): an unannounced square wave is a two-state
recurring regime, two numbers rather than one per piece, so the pieces both cost less (BIC) and are
each measured from every step at their level. Measured on the ladder in docs/research/revisit.md.

A stage on lna's hooks (run.py): lna's data, search, budget and fallbacks are lna's own. Noise-free
runs are lna's (the matrix's reading). lna's guard is applied to the result (lna.identify) and to
lna's own reading: where lna would return the matrix's model, so does this.
