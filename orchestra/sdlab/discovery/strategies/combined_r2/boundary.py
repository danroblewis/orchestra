"""The declared boundary (docs/research/declared-boundary.md): outside flows only where the case says the
system meets its environment.

A case may announce its boundary (Sterman's model-boundary chart): run["boundary"] = {stock: {"in":
[kinds], "out": [kinds]}} with run["boundary_declared"] = True, each kind "measured" (driven by a
measured input series) or "estimate" (exists; its form and rate are to be estimated). A stock not
listed has no outside flow. Nothing else about the truth is announced. Outside flows are a modelling
decision, not something discovery may invent, so:

- declared: an outside flow is allowed only on a declared stock and side, and of a declared kind (a
  "measured" side is fed by a flow that reads a measured input; an "estimate" side by an estimated
  form: a constant, pieces, a drain, a link). Everything else must be a flow between stocks, and
  unexplained wiggle is noise. A flow outside the boundary is never kept: it is dropped, or made a move
  between two stocks, whichever prices best (`guard`).
- not declared (real data, some probes): an outside flow is allowed but is a boundary claim, priced at
  CLAIM_PRICE x log T on top of its numbers (`price_claims`), and listed (`claims`).
- either way, an outflow from A and an inflow into B whose unexplained changes are anti-correlated
  (what one loses the other gains) are tried as the move A -> B (`pair_moves`), kept when it prices
  better.

The price of a structure is BIC on the one-step changes: -2 log L (Gaussian, one variance per stock)
plus log T per number, plus CLAIM_PRICE x log T per boundary claim. A hidden stock is inside the
boundary and pays only for its numbers (HIDDEN_PRICE = 0; the user, 2026-10-20). Numbers are refitted for every
structure compared (`Fit`), by least squares on the one-step changes, so a structure is never judged
with numbers fitted for another.

The module is self-contained (it imports only the shared simulator): strategies are isolated, so
another strategy copies this file into its own package (the "for copiers" section of the doc).
