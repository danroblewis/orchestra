"""The event bus: Orchestra's append-only, replayable log of facts.

Every backend keeps one ordered stream per project, under Orchestra's own namespace
(``orchestra.<project key>.events``), never mixed with anyone else's topics. Offsets are integers:
an offset is the number of events before a point in the stream, so ``read(0)`` starts at the
beginning and the offset ``read`` returns is where the next call should start. Callers treat
offsets as cursors and never do arithmetic on them.

Backends are chosen by URL (``open_bus``): ``file`` (the default, a JSONL file in the project's
state directory), ``redis://...`` (Redis Streams), ``amqp://...`` (a RabbitMQ stream queue) and
``kafka://host:port`` (one Kafka topic with one partition). Each server backend needs its client
library, installed with the matching extra (``orchestra[bus-redis]`` and so on).
